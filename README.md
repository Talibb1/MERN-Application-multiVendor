## Architecture Overview

### System Architecture

The system architecture consists of a client-side frontend built with Next.js and a backend API developed using Node.js and Express.js. MongoDB serves as the database, while AWS services like S3 and CloudFront handle file storage and content delivery.

### Data Flow

1. **Client Requests**: Users access the frontend, which communicates with the backend via RESTful APIs.
2. **Backend Processing**: The backend processes requests and interacts with the database.
3. **Data Storage**: User-uploaded files are stored in S3 buckets, while other data is managed in MongoDB.
4. **Response Handling**: The frontend receives data and renders it for user interaction.
